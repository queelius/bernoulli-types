\section{Why Perfect Is the Enemy of Good}

Imagine you're building a system to check if an email address has been compromised in a data breach. You have a database of 1 billion compromised emails, and users query your service millions of times per day. The traditional approach demands perfection: store all emails, search exactly, return precise results.

But what if we relaxed this requirement slightly? What if, instead of perfect accuracy, we accepted a 0.1\% chance of a false positive—incorrectly reporting an email as compromised when it isn't?

This simple change transforms everything:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Storage drops from 32GB to 1.5GB (95\% reduction)\footnote{Assuming 32 bytes per email address on average, versus 12 bits per element in an optimized Bloom filter}
    \item Query time drops from milliseconds to microseconds
    \item The system becomes cache-friendly
    \item We can distribute it globally without synchronization
\end{itemize}

This is the \textbf{approximation advantage}\index{approximation advantage}: by accepting controlled errors, we gain massive efficiency improvements. But the story doesn't end there. As we'll discover, this same approximation that improves efficiency also enables privacy.

\section{The Bloom Filter Revolution}

In 1970, Burton Bloom\index{Bloom, Burton} introduced a data structure that would quietly revolutionize computing. His insight was profound yet simple: we can test set membership using much less space if we accept false positives\index{false positive}.

\subsection{How Bloom Filters Work}

A Bloom filter\index{Bloom filter!operation} consists of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A bit array of size $m$
    \item $k$ independent hash functions\index{hash function} $h_1, h_2, \ldots, h_k$
\end{itemize}

To add an element $x$:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Compute $h_i(x)$ for $i = 1, \ldots, k$
    \item Set bits at positions $h_i(x) \bmod m$ to 1
\end{enumerate}

To test membership of $y$:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Compute $h_i(y)$ for $i = 1, \ldots, k$
    \item Check if all bits at positions $h_i(y) \bmod m$ are 1
    \item If yes: element is \emph{probably} in the set
    \item If no: element is \emph{definitely not} in the set
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{The Mathematics of Imperfection}

Let's derive the false positive rate\index{false positive rate}. After inserting $n$ elements:

\begin{theorem}[Bloom Filter False Positive Rate]
\index{Bloom filter!false positive rate}
The probability of a false positive is approximately:
\[
\text{fprate} = \left(1 - e^{-kn/m}\right)^k
\]
where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $m$ = number of bits in the filter
\item $n$ = number of elements inserted
\item $k$ = number of hash functions
\end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}[Proof Sketch]
The probability a specific bit is still 0 after $n$ insertions with $k$ hash functions is:
\[
p_0 = \left(1 - \frac{1}{m}\right)^{kn} \approx e^{-kn/m}
\]

For a false positive, all $k$ bits for a new element must be 1:
\[
\text{fprate} = (1 - p_0)^k = \left(1 - e^{-kn/m}\right)^k
\]
\end{proof}

\subsection{Optimal Parameters}
\index{Bloom filter!optimal parameters}

Given $n$ elements and desired false positive rate $p$, we can derive optimal parameters:

\begin{theorem}[Optimal Bloom Filter Parameters]
The optimal number of bits is:
\[
m = -\frac{n \ln p}{(\ln 2)^2} \approx -1.44 \cdot n \cdot \log_2 p
\]

The optimal number of hash functions is:
\[
k = \frac{m}{n} \ln 2 \approx 0.693 \cdot \frac{m}{n}
\]
\end{theorem}

For example, to store 1 billion items with 0.1\% false positive rate:
\begin{itemize}
\item $m = -10^9 \cdot \ln(0.001) / (\ln 2)^2 \approx 1.44 \times 10^{10}$ bits $\approx$ 1.7 GB
\item $k = 0.693 \cdot 14.4 \approx 10$ hash functions
\end{itemize}

\section{From Set Membership to Bernoulli Types}
\index{Bernoulli types|(}

Bloom filters are just the beginning. They belong to a broader class we call \textbf{Bernoulli types}—data structures where operations have probabilistic correctness.

\begin{definition}[Bernoulli Type]
\index{Bernoulli types!definition}
A Bernoulli type is a data structure where:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Operations may return incorrect results with bounded probability
\item Error rates are known and controllable
\item Errors are independent across operations
\item Space/time complexity is reduced compared to exact versions
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

Examples include:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Bernoulli Set} (Bloom filter): False positives, no false negatives
\item \textbf{Bernoulli Map}: Key-value store with probabilistic values
\item \textbf{Bernoulli Counter}: Approximate counting with bounded error
\item \textbf{Bernoulli Matrix}: Compressed matrix with probabilistic entries
\end{itemize}

\section{A Simple Implementation}

Let's implement a basic Bloom filter in Python\index{Python!Bloom filter}:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption={Basic Bloom filter implementation}]
import hashlib
import math

class BloomFilter:
    """A simple Bloom filter implementation"""
    
    def __init__(self, expected_items: int, fp_rate: float = 0.001):
        """Initialize with expected items and false positive rate"""
        # Calculate optimal size
        self.size = self._optimal_size(expected_items, fp_rate)
        # Calculate optimal number of hash functions
        self.num_hashes = self._optimal_hashes(expected_items, self.size)
        # Initialize bit array
        self.bits = [False] * self.size
        self.count = 0
        
    def _optimal_size(self, n: int, p: float) -> int:
        """Calculate optimal bit array size using formula:
        m = -n * ln(p) / (ln(2)^2)
        """
        m = -(n * math.log(p)) / (math.log(2) ** 2)
        return int(m)
    
    def _optimal_hashes(self, n: int, m: int) -> int:
        """Calculate optimal number of hash functions using formula:
        k = (m/n) * ln(2)
        """
        k = (m / n) * math.log(2)
        return max(1, int(k))
    
    def _hash(self, item: str, seed: int) -> int:
        """Generate hash with seed
        Note: This uses SHA-256 for demonstration. Production systems
        should use faster non-cryptographic hashes like MurmurHash3.
        """
        data = f"{item}:{seed}".encode()
        h = hashlib.sha256(data).digest()
        # Convert first 8 bytes to integer
        return int.from_bytes(h[:8], 'big') % self.size
    
    def add(self, item: str):
        """Add item to filter"""
        for i in range(self.num_hashes):
            pos = self._hash(item, i)
            self.bits[pos] = True
        self.count += 1
    
    def contains(self, item: str) -> bool:
        """Test membership (may have false positives)"""
        for i in range(self.num_hashes):
            pos = self._hash(item, i)
            if not self.bits[pos]:
                return False
        return True
    
    def false_positive_rate(self) -> float:
        """Calculate current false positive rate"""
        # Fraction of bits set to 1
        ones = sum(self.bits) / self.size
        # Probability of false positive
        return ones ** self.num_hashes
\end{lstlisting}

\section{The Privacy Connection (Preview)}
\index{privacy!approximation connection}

Here's where our story takes an unexpected turn. The same properties that make Bloom filters space-efficient also make them privacy-preserving:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Information Loss}: You can't extract the original elements from a Bloom filter
\item \textbf{Plausible Deniability}: False positives create uncertainty about true membership
\item \textbf{Uniform Representation}: With proper construction, filters look like random bit patterns
\end{enumerate}

In Chapter 4, we'll exploit these properties to build systems where queries reveal nothing about what's being searched. The approximation that saves space also hides information.

\section{When to Approximate}

Approximation isn't always appropriate. Use Bernoulli types when:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Scale demands it}: Exact solutions are too expensive
\item \textbf{Errors are tolerable}: False positives won't cause critical failures
\item \textbf{Bounds are acceptable}: You can work with probabilistic guarantees
\item \textbf{Privacy matters}: Information hiding is valuable
\end{itemize}

Avoid them when:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Correctness is critical}: Financial transactions, medical doses
\item \textbf{Errors compound}: Multiple operations amplify errors unacceptably
\item \textbf{Debugging is hard}: Probabilistic bugs are harder to reproduce
\item \textbf{Users expect exactness}: UI showing approximate counts confuses users
\end{itemize}

\section{Exercises}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Bloom Filter Basics}: Calculate the optimal number of hash functions for a Bloom filter with 10 million bits storing 1 million elements. What's the false positive rate?
    
    \item \textbf{Space Savings}: Compare the space needed to store 10 million URLs (average 50 characters) exactly versus using a Bloom filter with 0.1\% false positive rate.
    
    \item \textbf{Implementation}: Extend the Python implementation to support deletion (hint: use counting Bloom filters).
    
    \item \textbf{Analysis}: Prove that the optimal number of hash functions minimizes false positive rate. (Hint: take the derivative with respect to $k$.)
    
    \item \textbf{Research Question}: Can you design a data structure with false negatives but no false positives? What would be its use cases?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Chapter Summary}

We've seen how accepting small errors—the approximation advantage—yields massive efficiency gains. Bloom filters exemplify this principle: by accepting false positives, we reduce space by 95\% while maintaining microsecond query times.

This is just the beginning. Bernoulli types extend this concept to maps, counters, and more complex structures. Most importantly, the information loss inherent in approximation becomes a feature, not a bug, when we need privacy.

Next, we'll explore how hashing—the foundation of Bloom filters—can be transformed from a deterministic function to a privacy-preserving encoding.
