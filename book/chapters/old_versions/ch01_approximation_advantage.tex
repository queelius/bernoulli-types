\section{Why Perfect Is the Enemy of Good}

Imagine you're building a system to check if an email address has been compromised in a data breach. You have a database of 1 billion compromised emails, and users query your service millions of times per day. The traditional approach demands perfection: store all emails, search exactly, return precise results.

But what if we relaxed this requirement slightly? What if, instead of perfect accuracy, we accepted a 0.1\% chance of a false positive—incorrectly reporting an email as compromised when it isn't?

This simple change transforms everything:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Storage drops from 32GB to 1.5GB (95\% reduction)
    \item Query time drops from milliseconds to microseconds
    \item The system becomes cache-friendly
    \item We can distribute it globally without synchronization
\end{itemize}

This is the approximation advantage: by accepting controlled errors, we gain massive efficiency improvements. But the story doesn't end there. As we'll discover, this same approximation that improves efficiency also enables privacy.

\section{The Bloom Filter Revolution}

In 1970, Burton Bloom introduced a data structure that would quietly revolutionize computing: the Bloom filter. His insight was profound yet simple: we can test set membership using much less space if we accept false positives.

\subsection{How Bloom Filters Work}

A Bloom filter consists of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A bit array of size $m$
    \item $k$ independent hash functions
\end{itemize}

To add an element:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Hash the element with each of the $k$ hash functions
    \item Set the corresponding bits in the array to 1
\end{enumerate}

To test membership:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Hash the element with the same $k$ hash functions
    \item Check if all corresponding bits are 1
    \item If yes: element is \emph{probably} in the set
    \item If no: element is \emph{definitely not} in the set
\end{enumerate}

\begin{example}[Email Breach Checker]
Let's build a Bloom filter for our email breach checker:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]
class BreachChecker {
    BitArray bits(12'000'000);  // 1.5 MB for 1B emails
    array<HashFunction, 3> hashes;
    
    void add(const string& email) {
        for (auto& h : hashes) {
            bits.set(h(email) % bits.size());
        }
    }
    
    bool possibly_compromised(const string& email) {
        for (auto& h : hashes) {
            if (!bits.test(h(email) % bits.size())) {
                return false;  // Definitely not compromised
            }
        }
        return true;  // Probably compromised
    }
};
\end{lstlisting}

This implementation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Uses 1.5MB for 1 billion emails
    \item Has approximately 0.1\% false positive rate
    \item Never has false negatives
    \item Queries in constant time
\end{itemize}
\end{example}

\subsection{The Mathematical Magic}

The false positive rate of a Bloom filter is:
\[
\fprate \approx \left(1 - e^{-kn/m}\right)^k
\]

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $n$ = number of elements inserted
    \item $m$ = size of bit array
    \item $k$ = number of hash functions
\end{itemize}

The optimal number of hash functions is:
\[
k_{\text{optimal}} = \frac{m}{n} \ln 2 \approx 0.693 \frac{m}{n}
\]

This gives us a fundamental trade-off:
\[
m = -\frac{n \ln \fprate}{(\ln 2)^2} \approx -1.44 n \log_2 \fprate
\]

\begin{inpractice}
For practical systems, we typically choose:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\fprate = 0.001$ (0.1\%) for non-critical applications
    \item $\fprate = 0.0001$ (0.01\%) for important systems
    \item $\fprate = 0.00001$ (0.001\%) for critical infrastructure
\end{itemize}
Each order of magnitude reduction in false positive rate costs approximately 1.44 bits per element.
\end{inpractice}

\section{Trading Exactness for Efficiency}

Bloom filters are just the beginning. The principle of trading exactness for efficiency appears throughout computer science:

\subsection{Approximate Counting}

Instead of exact counts, we can use:

\textbf{Morris Counter}: Counts up to $n$ using only $O(\log \log n)$ bits
\begin{itemize}
    \item Increment with probability $2^{-c}$ where $c$ is current counter value
    \item Estimate count as $2^c - 1$
    \item Relative error decreases as count increases
\end{itemize}

\textbf{HyperLogLog}: Estimates cardinality of large sets
\begin{itemize}
    \item Uses $O(\log \log n)$ space for sets of size $n$
    \item Typical error rate: 2\%
    \item Powers database systems like Redis and PostgreSQL
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Approximate Nearest Neighbors}

Instead of finding the exact nearest neighbor, find one that's "close enough":

\textbf{Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH)}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Finds $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate nearest neighbor
    \item Reduces search time from $O(n)$ to $O(n^{\rho})$ where $\rho < 1$
    \item Powers similarity search in high dimensions
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Probabilistic Databases}

Instead of exact query results, return approximate answers with confidence intervals:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Sample-based query processing
    \item Orders of magnitude faster for aggregates
    \item Used in systems like BlinkDB and Quickr
\end{itemize}

\section{A First Look at Bernoulli Types}

These approximate data structures share a common pattern: they transform exact types into probabilistic ones. We formalize this as \emph{Bernoulli types}.

\begin{definition}[Bernoulli Type]
A Bernoulli type $\Bernoulli{2}{T}$ is a probabilistic approximation of type $T$ with controlled error rate $\errorrate$. Operations on Bernoulli types may return incorrect results with probability at most $\errorrate$.
\end{definition}

The superscript indicates the order:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\Bernoulli{0}{T}$ = Perfect (no errors)
    \item $\Bernoulli{1}{T}$ = Symmetric errors
    \item $\Bernoulli{2}{T}$ = Asymmetric errors (our focus)
\end{itemize}

\begin{example}[Bernoulli Boolean]
A Bernoulli Boolean $\BernoulliBool$ is a Boolean that might be wrong:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]
class BernoulliBoolean {
    bool value;
    double error_rate;
    
    BernoulliBoolean operator&&(const BernoulliBoolean& other) {
        // AND operation with error propagation
        bool result = value && other.value;
        double new_error = 1 - (1-error_rate)*(1-other.error_rate);
        return BernoulliBoolean{result, new_error};
    }
};
\end{lstlisting}
\end{example}

\begin{example}[Bernoulli Set]
A Bloom filter is a Bernoulli Set $\BernoulliSet{X}$:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Contains operation: $\BernoulliBool$ with false positive rate $\fprate$
    \item Union: Combines filters by OR-ing bit arrays
    \item Intersection: More complex (requires counting Bloom filters)
\end{itemize}
\end{example}

\subsection{Why "Bernoulli"?}

We name these types after Jacob Bernoulli because:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Each operation is like a Bernoulli trial (success/failure)
    \item Error probabilities follow Bernoulli distributions
    \item The mathematics builds on Bernoulli's probability theory
\end{enumerate}

\section{The Unexpected Connection to Privacy}

Here's where our story takes an unexpected turn. These same approximations that save space and time also provide privacy. How?

Consider our email breach checker. With a traditional exact database:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Queries reveal exactly which emails users are checking
    \item Access patterns leak information about user concerns
    \item The database itself is sensitive (contains all breached emails)
\end{itemize}

With a Bloom filter approach:
\begin{itemize}
    \item False positives provide plausible deniability
    \item The bit array reveals nothing about individual emails
    \item Even with full access, you can't extract the original data
\end{itemize}

But we can go further. What if we transform the Bloom filter so that:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Queries look like random noise
    \item Responses are indistinguishable from random
    \item Yet the system still functions correctly (with approximation)
\end{enumerate}

This is the genesis of \emph{oblivious computing}: using approximation not just for efficiency, but for privacy.

\section{Chapter Summary and Preview}

In this chapter, we've seen that:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Accepting approximation enables massive efficiency gains
    \item Bloom filters exemplify the approximation advantage
    \item Many successful systems trade exactness for efficiency
    \item Bernoulli types formalize probabilistic approximations
    \item Approximation unexpectedly enables privacy
\end{itemize}

But how exactly does approximation lead to privacy? In the next chapter, we'll discover the crucial link: hash functions and uniform distributions. We'll see how hashing transforms data into random-looking values, setting the stage for oblivious computing.
