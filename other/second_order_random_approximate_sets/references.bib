  title    = {Deriving a Fast Inverse of the Generalized CantorN-tupling Bijection},
  abstract = {We attack an interesting open problem (an efficient algorithm to invert the generalized Cantor N-tupling bijection) and solve it through a sequence of equivalence preserving transformations of logic programs, that take advantage of unique strengths of this programming paradigm.
An extension to set and multiset tuple encodings, as well as a simple application to a "fair-search" mechanism illustrate practical uses of our algorithms.

The code in the paper (a literate Prolog program, tested with SWI-Prolog and Lean Prolog) is available at http://logic.cse.unt.edu/tarau/research/2012/pcantor.pl.},
