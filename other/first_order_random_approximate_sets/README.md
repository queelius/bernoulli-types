# First-order approximate set model

This paper provides a theoretical treatment on first-order approximate sets,
a probabilistic model of generating an approximate set given some objective set where the probability of
an error (e.g., false positives or false negatives) occurs with some specified probability.

In practice, the error may be due to a rate distortion (lossy compression) or a noisy channel.
